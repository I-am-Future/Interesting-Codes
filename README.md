# Interesting-Codes

Some interesting codes I wrote, may not be innovative, may not be beautiful, may not be useful, but just because they are interesting, so I put them here.

+ `Simplex-Solver`: A simplex method based convex linear programming solver for my optimization course. May contain bugs.
+ `Mp4-to-Gif Convertor`: Input a mp4 video, output a gif image. Customizable parameters. 
+ `Image Quad Tree`: A quad tree based image blurring algorithm.
