# Interesting-Codes

Some interesting codes I wrote, may not be innovative, may not be beautiful, may not be useful, but just because they are interesting, so I put them here.

+ `Simplex-Solver`: A simplex method based convex linear programming solver for my optimization course. May contain bugs.
+ `Video Format Convertor`: Input a video, output a different format type (gif, mp4, avi...). Support customizable parameters. 
+ `Image Quad Tree`: A quad tree based image blurring algorithm.
+ `String-Match`: String match algorithm, including pattern (`*` and `?`) match and `strstr` implementation.
